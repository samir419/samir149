The hunger was a creature that lived inside Massai, gnawing at his ribs with every breath. At sixteen, his body was a map of lean muscle and old bruises, drawn by the unforgiving streets. Beside him, tucked under a flap of sodden cardboard, Njeri slept fitfully. Her small face, usually bright with a stubborn hope, was pinched tight, her tiny hands clenched over the hollow of her stomach. Watching her, Massai felt the creature in his own gut roar.

He’d watched the woman in the silken shawl for ten minutes. She’d emerged from the gleaming restaurant, a parcel of grilled chicken in hand, meant for the puffball dog straining at its jeweled leash. The aroma was a physical assault, sweet and smoky. Massai’s fingers closed around the two homemade spark balls in his pocket—party props stuffed with flash powder, his only inheritance from a father he barely remembered.

With a practiced flick, he sent them skittering across the cobblestones. They erupted in a cacophony of brilliant white light and sharp cracks. The woman shrieked, the dog yapped, and for three precious seconds, the world was dazzled. Massai was a ghost in the chaos, a blur of ragged clothes. He snatched the parcel, its warmth searing his palm, and vanished into the labyrinth of alleys he called home. The police whistles faded behind him, defeated by his parkour dance over walls and through forgotten drains. For a glorious moment, he was a king returning with his bounty.

The alley was a dead-end, stinking of wet stone and decay. He never heard them coming. A fist exploded into his kidney, and the world became a storm of pain. Tyrone’s laugh was a low, grating sound. At twenty-two, he was a king of a different kind, ruling over his band of four with casual brutality.

“Street tax, little thief,” Tyrone grinned, plucking the parcel from Massai’s limp grasp. The gang descended, a whirlwind of kicks and taunts before melting back into the shadows, leaving Massai curled around the ache of lost hope.

That night, the hunger was louder than ever. Njeri’s whimpers were tiny needles in his heart. He was staring at the pattern of water stains on the wall of their cardboard shelter when she appeared.

She was maybe a year older, her eyes holding a darkness that made Massai feel like a child. In her hands was a large, charred piece of meat on a stick.

“Saw what they did to you,” she said, her voice flat. “This is that dog. The one whose dinner you stole.”

Revulsion twisted Massai’s face. “Get away.”

She didn’t move. “Your goodness is a weight. It anchors you here, in the dirt, under their boots. That girl,” she nodded at Njeri, “she’ll starve wrapped in your morals.” She thrust the meat forward. “Survival isn’t pretty. It’s teeth and fire.”

Massai looked at Njeri, saw the tremor in her small frame. The creature inside him roared again, but this time, it wasn’t just hunger. It was something colder. He took the meat. It tasted of ash and a terrible, necessary choice.

The road to the capital was their only chance. At dawn, he woke Njeri, his resolve hardened. But Tyrone’s gang was like a bad smell, impossible to escape. They materialized at the city’s edge, blocking the main road.

“Leaving without saying goodbye?” Tyrone mocked.

Panic surged, but the cold thing in Massai’s chest was calmer. He shoved Njeri toward a reeking dumpster, hissing, “Stay. No matter what.” He turned, pulled his last two spark balls, and hurled them not at the ground, but at Tyrone’s face.

The gang leader flinched, swatting at the air. “You little—!” he roared, but Massai was already sprinting away from the dumpster, a deliberate, taunting lure.

“He’s mine!” Tyrone bellowed, shaking off his cautious friends who warned of the construction zone ahead. Wounded pride was a louder master than reason.

The half-built skeleton of a skyscraper loomed, a forest of steel and concrete. Massai scrambled up rebar lattices, his body remembering every desperate climb. Tyrone followed, heavier but fueled by fury. They climbed higher, the world shrinking below.

On a platform, Massai turned, cornered. Tyrone advanced, panting, a cruel smile on his lips. “No tricks left, sparky?”

Massai’s hand went to his empty pocket. He backed up, feigning terror, until his heel met the loose end of a cable coil. As Tyrone lunged, Massai kicked the coil, sending a spark ball he’d planted earlier rolling directly between the bandit’s feet. He snapped a second one against the steel beam behind him.

The twin detonations were blinding in the confined space. Tyrone screamed, clawing at his eyes, stumbling backward. His foot met empty air. He fell, but his hands caught the edge of the platform. He dangled, blind and helpless, over a sixty-foot drop.

“Help me!” The plea was raw, stripped of all its former arrogance. “Please, Massai!”

The wind whistled through the steel beams. Massai saw the alley, felt the blows, heard Njeri’s hungry cries. He saw the girl’s dark, knowing eyes. *Survival isn’t pretty.*

His own humanity felt like a distant, fragile thing, a spark ball that had already burned out. He looked at Tyrone’s straining fingers, at the blinded face turned up toward him.

Massai did not reach down. He took a single step back.

The scream was short, ended by a final, distant impact. The silence that followed was absolute, broken only by the wind. The cold thing inside Massai settled, becoming a part of him.

He retrieved a trembling Njeri from the dumpster, wiping a smudge from her cheek. He didn’t look back at the construction site. Hand in hand, they walked towards the sprawling capital city, its towers gleaming in the hazy sun. In Massai’s eyes, the reflection of those towers danced, no longer just structures of glass and steel, but steps on a ladder he would now climb by any means necessary. The fire in his gaze was new, fed not by hope, but by a merciful, ruthless fuel. The horizon awaited.
